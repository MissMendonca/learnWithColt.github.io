# API's
* Understand what it is an APi and how we can use it
    API stands for Application Programming Interface 
    It's how we can interact with data from external webpages.
    Through an API we can search for data from websites as Google Maps, facebook, tinder, reddit and others.
    
* JSON and XML
    JSON stands for Javascript Object Notation and it exactly looks like a JS 
    object but made with strings.
    XML stands for extended markup language and it's syntactily similiar to Html, but it does
    not describe presentation like HTML does.
    Data from an API will be presented in a JSON or XML format.
